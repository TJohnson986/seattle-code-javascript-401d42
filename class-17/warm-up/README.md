# Warm Up - Inserting values into a Binary Search Tree

## Overview

In order to properly utilize a Binary Search Tree, we have to correctly sort and append values amongst the other Nodes of the Tree. If we know how to traverse the tree and insert values, we should be able to iterate through a set of values, and insert each one seperately.  

## Challenge

Create a function that takes an `Array` of values, and can appropriately insert them into a Binary Search Tree.  Feel free to use any methods you have previously created on a Binary Search Tree.

```javascript

class Node  {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

class BinarySearchTree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = null;
  }

  insertMany(values) {
    // how can we insert all these values into our tree
  }
}

```

* What steps should be taken to be able to insert values from an array?
  * Describe what a computer needs to do at each step without using a programming language.
