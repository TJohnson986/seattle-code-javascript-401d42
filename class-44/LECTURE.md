## Lightening Talk

  * What are they?
    * Special types of functions that can stop mid way a the execution.
    * Uses the `yield` keyword to make stopping points in the generator function.
  * When do we use?
    * Iterating for the most part.
    * Helps us to make better loops.
      * Let's us pause during a loop.
      * Perhaps this could be great for event handling on the front end.
